/* ==================== Fade-In Animation ==================== */

/**
 * Keyframe definition for fade-in animation
 * 
 * This animation transitions an element from completely transparent (opacity: 0)
 * to fully visible (opacity: 1). It's used for the "We are..." headline to create
 * a dramatic entrance effect when the page loads.
 * 
 * The animation is simple but effective:
 * - Starts at 0% opacity (invisible)
 * - Ends at 100% opacity (fully visible)
 * - Browser automatically interpolates the values in between
 * 
 * Browser Support:
 * - Chrome/Edge: Full support
 * - Firefox: Full support
 * - Safari: Full support
 * - All modern browsers support @keyframes
 */
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

/**
 * Utility class to apply fade-in animation
 * 
 * This class can be applied to any element that should fade in when it appears.
 * The animation properties are carefully tuned for optimal visual effect:
 * 
 * - animation-name: fadeIn (references the keyframes above)
 * - animation-duration: 2s (two seconds for a slow, dramatic entrance)
 * - animation-timing-function: ease-out (starts quickly, then decelerates)
 * - animation-fill-mode: forwards (maintains final state after animation completes)
 * 
 * Timing Function Explanation:
 * - ease-out: The animation starts at full speed and gradually slows down
 * - This creates a more natural feel than linear timing
 * - The deceleration makes the element "settle" into place
 * 
 * Fill Mode Explanation:
 * - forwards: After the animation completes, the element retains the final state (opacity: 1)
 * - Without this, the element would snap back to its initial state
 * 
 * Usage:
 * Apply this class to any element in your JSX:
 * <div className="animate-fade-in">Content that fades in</div>
 * 
 * Customization:
 * - To make the animation faster: Change 2s to 1s or 1.5s
 * - To make it slower: Change 2s to 3s or 4s
 * - To change the easing: Try ease-in, ease-in-out, or linear
 * - To add a delay: Add animation-delay: 0.5s; (delays start by 0.5 seconds)

.animate-fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 2s ease-out forwards;
}

/**
 * Alternative Animation Variations (Optional)
 * 
 * Uncomment these if you want additional animation options:
 */

/*
 * Faster fade-in (1 second)
 */
/*
.animate-fade-in-fast {
  animation: fadeIn 1s ease-out forwards;
}
*/

/*
 * Slower fade-in (3 seconds)
 */
/*
.animate-fade-in-slow {
  animation: fadeIn 3s ease-out forwards;
}
*/

/*
 * Fade-in with delay (starts after 0.5 seconds)
 */
/*
.animate-fade-in-delayed {
  animation: fadeIn 2s ease-out 0.5s forwards;
}
*/

/**
 * Accessibility Consideration: Respecting User Preferences
 * 
 * Some users experience discomfort or distraction from animations and may enable
 * "prefers-reduced-motion" in their operating system settings. We should respect
 * this preference by disabling or simplifying animations for these users.
 * 
 * Uncomment the code below to implement this accessibility feature:
 */

/*
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .animate-fade-in {
    animation: none;
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
*/

/**
 * Performance Notes:
 * 
 * 1. Opacity animations are highly performant:
 *    - Browsers can hardware-accelerate opacity changes
 *    - No layout recalculation or repainting required
 *    - Smooth 60 FPS animation on most devices
 * 
 * 2. CSS animations vs JavaScript animations:
 *    - CSS animations run on the compositor thread
 *    - JavaScript animations run on the main thread
 *    - CSS is generally more performant for simple animations
 * 
 * 3. Will-change optimization (optional):
 *    If you notice performance issues on low-end devices, you can add:
 *    will-change: opacity;
 *    This tells the browser to optimize for opacity changes in advance.
 *    However, use sparingly as it consumes memory.

/**
 * Integration Checklist:
 * 
 * After adding this code to globals.css, verify:
 * ✓ The @keyframes fadeIn rule is present
 * ✓ The .animate-fade-in class is present
 * ✓ No syntax errors (check browser console)
 * ✓ The animation plays when you load the Meet the Team page
 * ✓ The headline becomes visible over 2 seconds
 * ✓ The headline remains visible after the animation completes
 * 
 * If the animation doesn't work:
 * 1. Check that the class is applied in page.tsx: className="animate-fade-in"
 * 2. Verify there are no CSS conflicts overriding the animation
 * 3. Check browser DevTools for CSS errors
 * 4. Try hard-refreshing the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
 * 5. Ensure your build process is including the updated CSS
